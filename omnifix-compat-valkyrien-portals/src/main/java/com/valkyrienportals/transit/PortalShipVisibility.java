/**
 * Makes Valkyrien Skies ships in a <em>remote</em> dimension trackable by players looking at that
 * dimension through an Immersive Portals portal — the server half of KNOWN_ISSUES #0.
 *
 * <p><b>Measured root cause (probes, 2026-06-16):</b> VS's per-player ship tracking is derived from
 * chunk watching, and the chunk-watch computation hard-gates on
 * {@code ship.chunkClaimDimension == player.dimension} before any other check — so the server never
 * sends {@code PacketShipDataCreate}/transform updates for another dimension's ships, and the client
 * has literally nothing to render through the portal (branch B of the ShipDataProbe decision matrix).
 *
 * <p><b>The data plane already works:</b> VS's own {@code MixinIpNewChunkTrackingGraph} feeds shipyard
 * chunks of ships near a portal destination into IP's cross-dimension chunk sync, so block data and
 * block updates for remote ships reach the correct remote {@code ClientLevel} through IP's wrapped
 * packets. Only the ship <em>metadata</em> path (create/remove/transform packets — all VS-custom,
 * dimension-tagged, safe cross-dimension) is blocked by the tracker gate.
 *
 * <p><b>This class</b> computes, a few times a second, which remote ships each player can plausibly
 * see: for every IP portal near the player whose destination is another dimension, ships intersecting
 * a box around the portal's exit. Those ship ids are (a) published to
 * {@link #seesShip(UUID, long)} for {@code MixinVsCoreChunkTrackerPortalDims}, which relaxes the
 * tracker's dimension gate for exactly these (player, ship) pairs, and (b) added to the player's
 * {@link MinecraftPlayer#getForceWatchingShips() force-watching set}, which the tracker consults in
 * place of its distance check — necessary because the player's position is in another dimension's
 * coordinate space, so the distance test can never pass. Both marks are withdrawn symmetrically when
 * the player or the ship leaves the portal neighbourhood, which routes the tracker into its natural
 * unwatch branch and sends the client a regular {@code PacketShipRemove}.
 *
 * <p>The vanilla chunk-tracking side effects of cross-dimension watching are suppressed by
 * {@code MixinChunkMapCrossDimGuard} and {@code MixinChunkManagementUntrackGuard} — vanilla chunk
 * packets carry no dimension context, so letting VS route them to a cross-dimension player would
 * corrupt the player's <em>current</em> level with the remote shipyard's chunk data (ship chunk
 * claims are allocated per dimension and can overlap numerically). IP's chunk sync already delivers
 * the same data with correct dimension routing, so nothing is lost by suppressing the vanilla path.
 *
 * <p>Not an {@code @Mod.EventBusSubscriber}: OmniFix treats VS and IP as optional, so this class is
 * registered on the Forge bus by {@code ValkyrienPortalsCompatBootstrap} only when both are present —
 * auto-subscription would class-load the VS/IP imports in packs that lack them.
